#Endless Runner
***

**Endless Runner** is a 3D game I'm building to learn game development with the Godot game engine.  
This is a simple game where the player jumps over obstacles while running along a road. The game is in prototype stage and currently only has jumping, obstacles and a few environment elements implimented. In the future, I'll be adding scores for collecting coins and distanced travelled and maybe some parkour skill moves.

You can find a basic prototype at [itch.io](https://fireashfire.itch.io/endurance-runner). My ultimate aim is to create games exclusively using free and open-source technologies (FOSS) and this project is the first step in that journey.

This project is built using:
1. Godot 3.1 (game engine with gdscript)
2. Blender 2.8x (modelling, animation)
3. Krita 4.x & Gimp 2.x (Image editing, texturing)
